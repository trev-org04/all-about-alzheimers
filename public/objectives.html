            <li>Our project involved three primary objectives focused on Alzheimer's disease. The first objective was to inform the community regarding the risk factors, symptoms, and effective strategies for reducing the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's. The second objective aimed to elevate awareness on a broader scale to increase understanding and recognition of Alzheimer's within the community. Lastly, our third objective was to contribute to Alzheimer's research through fundraising. By accomplishing these objectives, we can effectively fight against the stigma associated with the disease. </li>
            <li>Our awareness campaign aims to educate and reach 5,000 community members about Alzheimer's disease through infographics, informational pamphlets, and social media pages. We plan to achieve this by advertising and distributing our resources in local libraries, hospitals, and fitness centers. Additionally, our campaign aims to engage 250 members of the community in advocating for increased funding for Alzheimer's research and support groups by organizing a tennis tournament and conducting outreach through presentations.</li>
